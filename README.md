This is a bridge from Copilot in VS Code, or any MCP-capable client, to knowledge about Houdini and Houdini networks.

## Quick Start üöÄ

Want to use Zabob with Claude or another AI assistant right now?

üëâ **[Follow our Docker setup guide](docs/user/claude-docker-setup.md)**

Just add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zabob": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "bobkerns/mcp-server:latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then configure your AI assistant to connect to the MCP server. Full instructions in the [user documentation](docs/user/README.md).

## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.

## Development

This is still in early-stage development, but you can read the [development plan](DEVELOPMENT.md) and details about how the development environment works.

Contributions are encouraged! You can read the [contribution policy](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Subprojects

This project is divided into [subprojects](SUBPROJECTS.md). As a result, the VSCode explorer view does not exactly match the structure of the file system. For example, the [houdini/](houdini/README.md) folder holds multiple Houdini connection projects; these are presented in the explorer as being at top level, siblings to the root of the project.

In addition, I have enabled collapsing multiple related files into a single collapsed entry. The top-level `README.md` can be expanded to reveal the various top-level `.md` files, and `packages.json` displays the `.lock` file as a child. This helps minimize clutter in the explorer view.

## Release Process

This will have the [Release process](RELEASE.md) when it's ready.
