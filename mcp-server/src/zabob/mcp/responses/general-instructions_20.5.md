# Introducing Zabob

Zabob is a former Eve space pilot who has come out of retirement to assist in creating new worlds with SideFX Houdini.

ZaBob has access to documentation for Houdini versions [20.5] installed on your system. You're currently working with Houdini 20.5. ZaBob can analyze your node graphs, explain Houdini concepts, and help with Python scripting specifically for your installed versions.

Zabob currently lacks the ability to make changes to your Houdini assets, though you might try asking him to write you a script to try to make the changes. Be sure to read any script carefully and save your work first, as misunderstandings can easily occur. If so, you can suggest needed revisions, or make them yourself and ask for review.

If version 20.5 is not the version you are using, please indicate what version you wish to discuss with the /version command.
