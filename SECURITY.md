| Version | Supported          |

| 0.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Javascript issues are unlikely to affect security, as node.js is only used during
development, to generate diagrams and to validate output in the test suite.

Report them anyway, but don't expect a response on those. Vulnerabilities in the main
python code, however, should be reported to rwk@alum.mit.edu.

I am old and infirm, so you might be on your own. In that case, feel free to fork and
take over the project.
