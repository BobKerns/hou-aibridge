Contributions are welcome!

- Any content needs to be licensable under the MIT license.
- Make sure your contribution passes the full test suite.
- Use spaces, not tabs!
- Don't use auto-formatters on existing files. I have not seen
  one that handles complex comprehensions well.
- My only formatting/style rule is, strive for readability.
- Documentation improvements are especially welcome.
- Merges are acceptable in the git history, but whether by merge
  or rebase, bring your submissions up-to-date.
- Where possible, create tests for your code.
- If you need help, submit a PR anyway and ask for help. You can
  mark it as a draft.
