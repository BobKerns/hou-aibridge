# Zabob: The AI Bridge to Houdini SFX

![Zabob in front of a future city](docs/images/zabob-holodeck-text.jpg)

This is a bridge from Copilot in VS Code, or any MCP-capable client, to knowledge about Houdini and Houdini networks.

Just setting up the project; more to come.

## Features

* Connects Copilot and other MCP-aware chat interfaces to Houdini knowledge.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

TODO:
Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

\[TBD]

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Known Issues

## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.

## Development

This is still in early-stage development, but you can read the [development plan](DEVELOPMENT.md)

Contributions are encouraged! You can read the [contribution policy](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Subprojects

This project is divided into [subprojeccts](SUBPROJECTS.md). As a result, the VSCode explorer view does not exactly match the structure of the file system. For example, the [houdini/](houdini/README.md) folder holds multiple Houdini connection projects; these are presented in the explorer as being at top level, siblings to the root of the project.

In addition, I have enabled collapsing multiple related files into a single collapsed entry. The top-level `README.md` can be expanded to reveal the various top-level `.md` files, and `packages.json` displays the `.lock` file as a child. This helps minimize clutter in the explorer view.

## Release Process

This will have the [Release process](RELEASE.md) when it's ready.
